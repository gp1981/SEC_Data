To do this, we will use R and several libraries that facilitate data retrieval and analysis.\nTo start, we need to import the required libraries. These libraries provide functions and tools that enable us to interact with the SEC’s data and perform data analysis.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # A collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization\nlibrary(httr)       # An R interface to the 'curl' package, allowing HTTP requests\nlibrary(jsonlite)   # A lightweight JSON encoder and decoder for R"

We’ll be sourcing these files in the main script (main_script.R) to access the functions for retrieving, processing, and analyzing SEC data.\nLet’s start by sourcing these files in your main_script.R. Here’s how you can do it:\n\nsource(\"../code/Functions/data_retrieval.R\")   # Sourcing the data retrieval functions\nsource(\"../code/Functions/data_analysis.R\")    # Sourcing the data analysis functions\nsource(\"../code/Functions/data_visualization.R\")  # Sourcing the data visualization functions\nsource(\"../code/Functions/utils.R\")           # Sourcing utility functions\n\nThis sets the stage for retrieving and working with SEC data efficiently."

In this example, we will focus on one company, Apple Inc. (AAPL), as the target for our data retrieval.\n\n2.3.1 Define User Headers\nTo access the SEC API, we need to define user headers. These headers will be used for making HTTP requests to the SEC servers. We can set our user agent as an example:\n\n# Define user headers\nheaders &lt;- c('User-Agent' = 'email@address.com')\nprint(headers)\n\n         User-Agent \n\"email@address.com\" \n\n\nIt’s essential to set user headers as a standard practice when accessing web APIs to identify the source of the requests."
